 The copyright holders of Gmsh give you permission to combine Gmsh
 with code included in the standard release of TetGen (from Hang Si),
 Netgen (from Joachim Sch"oberl), Chaco (from Bruce Hendrickson and
 Robert Leland at Sandia National Laboratories) and METIS (from
 George Karypis at the University of Minnesota) under their
 respective licenses. You may copy and distribute such a system
 following the terms of the GNU GPL for Gmsh and the licenses of the
 other code concerned, provided that you include the source code of
 that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of
 source code.

 Note that people who make modified versions of Gmsh are not
 obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
 versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General
 Public License gives permission to release a modified version
 without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to
 release a modified version which carries forward this exception.

 End of exception.

 Chaco has been slightly modified for integration into the Gmsh program.  Most
 changes are to 'main/interface.c'.  Elsewhere, the 'printf' routine has been
 defined as Gmsh_printf to write through a Gmsh Msg::Info.  All other
 modifications are tagged by 'Gmsh' and 'Gmsh - end'
